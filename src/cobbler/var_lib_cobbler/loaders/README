** DISCLAIMER **

In order to network install ("netboot") various arches, different boot loaders are required
for each architecture.  Unfortunately for Enterprise Linux and Fedora, these packages
are not available to all arches.

The requirements for netbooting each are as follows:

x86/x86_64 require syslinux (pxelinux.0), and menu.c32
ppc/ppc64  use yaboot
ia64       uses elilo

This is further complicated by Fedora not supporting IA64 and needing to provide
the same content to Debian and other install bases using the install server.

So, to faciliate providing content for users that do not wish to source content manually
these are supplied from https://cobbler.github.io as an optional way of getting that content.

Users may also want to use the latest versions of these packages from source or supply
their own from another source -- these are provided only for convience.

We are not responsible for ensuring these versions are up to date, but if you would like
to see a later version made available here email the project mailing list.
